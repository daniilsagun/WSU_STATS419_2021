  Hello friend, I am Daniil Sagun. I am taking multivariate statistics because It is part of my journey to get a bachelor’s degree in data analytics with a focus on business. The reason I am going for this career choice is because I have always had an interest in business and the best way to optimize one, this was combined with the fact that I always had a knack for understanding mathematical concepts and interpreting data. With this degree and the knowledge that comes with it I am hoping I will have the ability to go into a company, collect, review, and analyze their data, and conclude what steps they need to take to adapt and change, or where they need to invest their future energies into. Ideally this course and others like it will give me the tools to interpret multiples sets of complex data and will allow me to interpret them.


  I will admit the destination is seemingly verry far away and distant, especially with all the negative habits I have developed from high schools AP classes and my first 2 years of college. During my high school career between 2014-2018 where I ended with a  4.15 cumulative GPA where I took 10 ap classes and passed most of them with a 5, two 4’s, and six 3’s. With the results progressively getting worse, as in my senior year I received three 3’s and a 2. I was supposed to use AP classes to build up my work ethic and to develop healthy studying and research skills. The ease of them however lead me to procrastinate as I found the AP tests to be too easy at the end of the year. This is all to say that I have experienced the taste of potential and am now I am in a tough situation as my College career is facing a similar trend, as my grades have gotten progressively worse with the last semester being the worst 3 months of school I’ve ever had, I ended up having to drop 2 classes to barely scrape together a 2.33 Gpa for the semester. The issue is I know how easy and simple the solution is, to simply keep up to date on all of my assignments and spend a spare hour or two studying a week a class, but somehow, I always find myself at the end of the week with 3 assignments dues and only 12 hours left until the deadline. I am truly hoping that the failure in the previous semester will keep me in the correct mindset with the harsh truth that I can easily fail any class no matter how easy it appears on the surface. Figuring out where you are is honestly the most daunting thing as once you actually do come to a conclusion about your current situation you have nothing to do but to face the truth and to do something about it. A big idea my mother always engrained into me was the idea of if you are going to do something do it right and to its completion. The sad result is the easiest way to interpret that idea and the follow it is to simply never make the designated effort into a project or course. As then the fear of failure gives you the excuse of “well I didn’t invest all my time and effort so obviously my grade will suck, but at least I passed, right?”, and as long as you don’t actually look into it and realize you are failing to learn and to grow as a person as you don’t want to invest yourself into any one thing, because then there would be no excuse, no comfort and no blame to put on yourself. 
  

  I’m not going to kid myself or you and claim that I will put in 100% of my effort into every one of your assignments as when I inevitably am unable to complete it in the correct format or timeframe there will be a long list of excuses to explain away the failures of my work. Its been the same for a majority of my classes, with most teachers having an initial interest in my progress and success and then my proceeding failure to succeed resulting in the eventual disappointment and mercy grade. I mean its not like I won’t put in effort or try but the amount of effort I put in and the results are probably going to be disapointary, both to me and to you as a professor. I truly am interested in learning and will be intrigued for a majority of the time and will hopefully retain enough information and knowledge to pass the course and continue on in my career but that somehow doesn’t intrinsically lead me to put in the work and effort, sad but true. In the end it will be interesting to see if I am actually able to keep up in this course and to what degree I am able to find success within your course. I am looking forward to this opportunity as you seem to be passionate about your role as a professor and seem to enjoy sharing more than just raw facts, but reasons and explanations behind why you choose to approach things in a specific way. This does slow down the class a bit, but I believe understanding why we will use a specific code is just as important as to what the code is as to interpret the results you must understand how the results you get make sense and why the process to get there is the way it is and not any other way.
  
  
  As I said earlier, all of this stuff is interesting as I honestly believe there is truth to the idea that understanding patterns in one area can be applied to many others and that there is an intrinsic pattern to the way the world works, and unearthing that patters is really enticing. A moment I noticed this was when I was working foundation over the summer, and the basic principle of preparing the molds to pour the foundation for a house is a simple fact that perfection doesn’t exist in reality. When your preparing the molds the only conceivable method to create a stable foundation is to first start by working on soft malleable dirt, building molds that will topple over with a simple shove. But once you’ve established those molds and they aren’t necessarily stable, but simply strong enough to hold in the cement and not leak any, then you are able to pour those molds. Once they are poured it doesn’t matter that the concrete foundation stands on dirt or sand, or that it may be a couple mm shorter here or there, the strength of the foundation and its ability to stay exactly as it is in one place allows the rest of the house to be built no matter how soft the dirt was or any minor issues in the wall. Only with a relatively straight and relatively correct foundation can you start to continue to build up the frame and actually approach getting a relatively straight and level frame. In the end only the finished product that is visible will be judged, as long as the drywall is straight, and the siding on the outside isn’t obviously crooked then any blemishes throughout the process are covered up and lost. To be able to get a level house with level siding and straight walls there are a series of rushed steps that serve to be a stable base, not a representation of what the final product will be, but a foundation of the home. These ideas can serve as a metaphor for many things and can help understand a lot, for example to be content with how the beginning of your life turned out as your foundation, no matter how crooked or what issues you ran into on the way. 

  
  My hope is with this degree I will be able to collect, analyze and interpret the patterns of the world better and will be able to apply these patterns to other aspects, whether it be my own life or how a business can help itself. So with this course I am hoping to learn how to analyze data sets and how their multiple variables effect various things. To be able to find what is most impactful to the whole and what is least impactful. How to process what important even means in the first place and what conclusions can be drawn from said data. This is what interests me and hopefully I will be able to leave this course with this knowledge and the ability to calculate and do this myself with the data.
  
  
  In the end where I imagine myself is building my own business whatever it may be, to find opportunities in the vastness of the world and to be able to help others perfect their dreams would be my dream job.
